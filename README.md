# Wheres-Waldo-API

[NodeJS - Where's Waldo Project - The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/nodejs-where-s-waldo-a-photo-tagging-app)

This is one of the final projects under the Fullstack Javascript Development curriculum for The Odin Project. The purpose of this project was to clone the popular book/game series, Where's Waldo. The application allow users to pick a level and find all the hidden characters. Upon finishing, the user can enter their username to save their time/highscore to the leaderboard.

This repository is for the backend/API side of the application.

## Lessons Learned

This project was another opportunity to strengthen my experience with the Full Stack process. On the API side, getting the Where's Waldo app setup was fairly simple. It mostly builds off of the previous projects from TOP. However, it provided more experience with setting up a proper REST API. I did learn how to set up a timer on the backend using performance.now(). This was implemented to prevent score hackers on the client side! I also learned how to use Supertest and Jest to do testing on the backend!
